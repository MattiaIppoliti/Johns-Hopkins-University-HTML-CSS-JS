## [[1.4 Boxes]]
Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position.  CSS layout is mostly based on the _box model._ Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:
-   `padding`, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.
-   `border`, the solid line that is just outside the padding.
-   `margin`, the space around the outside of the border. By default on any browser it is not set to `0`.
![three boxes sat inside one another. From outside to in they are labelled margin, border and padding|400](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/box-model.png)

In this section we also use:

-   `width` (of an element).
-   `background-color`, the color behind an element's content and padding.
-   `color`, the color of an element's content (usually text).
-   `text-shadow` sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.
-   `display` sets the display mode of an element. (keep reading to learn more)

#### 1.4.1 Changing the page color

```css
html {
  background-color: #00539F;
}
```


This rule sets a background color for the entire page. 

#### 1.4.2 Styling the body

```css
body {
  width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: #FF9500;
  padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

There are several declarations for the [`<body>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) element. Let's go through these line-by-line:

-   `width: 600px;` This forces the body to always be 600 pixels wide.
-   `margin: 0 auto;` In `margin` or `padding`, the first value affects the element's top _and_ bottom side (setting it to `0` in this case); the second value affects the left _and_ right side. (Here, `auto` is a special value that divides the available horizontal space between left and right). You can also use one, three, or four values, as documented in [Margin Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin#syntax).
-   `padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;` This sets four values for padding. The goal is to put some space around the content. In this example, there is no padding on the top of the body, and 20 pixels on the right, bottom and left. The values set top, right, bottom, left, in that order. As with `margin`, you can use one, two, three, or four values, as documented in [Padding Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding#syntax).
-   `border: 5px solid black;` This sets values for the width, style and color of the border. In this case, it's a five-pixel–wide, solid black border, on all sides of the body.

#### 1.4.3 Positioning and styling the main page title

```css
h1 {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px 0;
  color: #00539F;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px black;
}
```

 `text-shadow` applies a shadow to the text content of the element. Its four values are:

-   The first pixel value sets the **horizontal offset** of the shadow from the text: how far it moves across.
-   The second pixel value sets the **vertical offset** of the shadow from the text: how far it moves down.
-   The third pixel value sets the **blur radius** of the shadow. A larger value produces a more fuzzy-looking shadow.
-   The fourth value sets the **base color of the shadow**.

#### 1.4.5 Centering the image

```css
img {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
Next, we center the image to make it look better. We could use the `margin: 0 auto` trick again as we did for the body. But there are differences that require an additional setting to make the CSS work.

The [`<body>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) is a **block** element, meaning it takes up space on the page. The margin applied to a block element will be respected by other elements on the page. In contrast, images are **inline** elements, for the auto margin trick to work on this image, we must give it block-level behavior using `display: block;`.

#### 1.4.6 Changing the default behavior of elements

A good example is our `<ul>`, an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I decide I don't want those bullets I can remove them like so:
```css
li {
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

#### 1.4.7 Border-Box
In general when we set the width, we are changing the width of  the entire content (box + padding + border) and not oly of the box. So When we specify the heigh and width we can use the 
```css
box-sizing: border-box;
```
whereas the default value is
```css
box-sizing: content-box;
```
![[Pasted image 20211217130113.png|325]]                               ![[Pasted image 20211217130138.png|350]]
Every modern framework works with `border-box`. But we don't wanna specificate it for every box inside our style.css file. Box-sizing is *not inherited*. You can't set it on the parent element and then expect that the child elements will inherit that property. 

So how do we get around that? Well, the way we get around it is by learning the **star** selector.
```css
*{
	box-sizing:border-box;
}
```

What star does, star selector says is, go ahead and select every element there is and apply these particular CSS properties to them. It is used to **resect** the browser default style.
#### 1.4.8 Overflow
By default if the content inside a box is bigger than the box itself, the content overflowed will be visible:
```css
#box{
	backgroud-color: blue;
	padding: 10px;
	border: 5px solid black;
	width: 300px;
	height: 50px;
	margin-top: 50px;
	overflow: visible;
}
```
![[Pasted image 20211217134903.png|500]]
But we can `hidden` then or  put `auto` scroll bars to  look at the entire content. Or `scroll` up and down. Usually that is done inside terms and approval
```css
#box{
	overflow: hidden
}
```

### 1.5 The backgroud proprety
One important propriety is the `backgroud-image`. The URL that we supply has to be relative to the way the CSS file is served in the browser.
```css
#box{
	backgroud-color: blue;
	backgroud-image: url("mattia.png");
}
```
BY default the image is repeated,  but we have different options if we want to display it in a certain way, using `background-repeat`.
```css
#box{
	backgroud-image: url("mattia.png");
	background-repeat: no-repeat;/* Top left corner by default */
	background-position: bottom right;/* we specify first the orizontal and then the vertical*/
	background-position: right;/* Specifing only one of this two, will make the other one in the center by default*/
}
```

### 1.6 Positioning elements by Floating

Most of the UIs today, web UIs today that are made, are made by floating the elements. Let's add the `float:right` and see what happens:
```css
#box{
	div {
		background-color: #00FFFF;
		}
	p {
		width: 50px;
		height: 50px;
		border: 1px solid black;
		}
	#p1 {
		background-color: #A52A2A;
		float: right;
		}
	}
```
If we flow the second element to the right,  the box jumped all the way to the right, top edge of the containing element.
![[Pasted image 20211217180652.png|250]]   -->   ![[Pasted image 20211217175912.png|330]]
There are also *two* other things to look at:
- **First**, is that you could see that the rest of them **moved up as if the maroon box isn't there anymore**. And the reason this is happening is because when you float elements, **the browser takes them *out* of the regular document flow**. 
- **Second** thing to notice is that even though each one of these paragraph boxes has a margin around them, as you can see that there's a margin between each one of them right here, that margin collapses as we've learned before when it is touching the margin of another element. However, **when it comes to floated elements, the margins *never collapse***. 
	Also, if you paid close attention, you will notice that the blue, light blue box, became **shorter**.

 Let's go ahead and **remove the float right**, and instead make **every single paragraph box float to the left**. And to ensure that the boxes aren't squished right against the other, let's go ahead and give it a **margin-right of let's say 10 px**.
```css
#box{
	div {
		background-color: #00FFFF;
		}
	p {
		width: 50px;
		height: 50px;
		border: 1px solid black;
		float: left;
		margin-right: 10px;
		}
	#p1 {
		background-color: #A52A2A;
		float: right;
		}
	}
```
Our `<div>` seemed to have completely collapsed. This is happening because of the same point that I made before. When you float elements it takes them *out of the regular document flow*, therefore it **collapses and hide**. In order to correct it, we need to tell the browser that when it comes to this section element, the browser should *resume the regular document flow.* And the way that we do that is by using the **clear property**.
```css
section{
	clear: left;
}
```
![[Pasted image 20211217182100.png|350]] -->  ![[Pasted image 20211217182405.png|350]]
It's used to say that **nothing should be allowed to flow to the left of it.**

Now, let's make the second 100px and lets now make element number 1 150 pixels and refresh you can see now it's overlapping. What we can do in this situation?
 In order to ensure that both columns, or both left and right Floated elements are not encroaching one another,  We could just say, clear `both`.
```css
#p3{
	background-color:#xxxxx;
	clear: both;
}
```
![[Pasted image 20211217182654.png|300]]-->![[Pasted image 20211217183144.png|275]]

What if we wanna a two column design?
 In order to achive it, we have to use not the default box sizing, which is `content-box`, but the `border-box`.
 ```css
#box{
	* {
		box-sizing: border-box
	}
	p {
		width: 50px;
		/*border: 1px solid black;*/
		float: left;
		padding: 10px;
		}
	#p1 {
		background-color: #A52A2A;
		float: right;
		}
	}
```

### 1.7 Static Positioning

**Static positioning** is basically a different way of saying normal document flow. It is actually a default setting for all elements, except html. A different type of positioning scheme is called relative positioning. 

When you apply **position relative** on an element. The element is positioned relative to its position in the normal document flow. In other words, if you were to apply offsets on that element, there will be offset, from the original normal document flow position of that element. So the positioning CSS offset properties are:
- top, 
- bottom, 
- left
- right. 

So when you position element as relative you're basically creating like an anchor for the offsets.

_Example *Absolute Position*_: So if we set the *position absolute* on number one, element two moved up underneath element one since element one is no longer part of the document flow. Element two doesn't think it's even there.

A really cool feature of this combination is, that **if your container element, is itself offset**, *everything inside of that container is offset with it.* So you could set our particular layout with a container element. And then move that container element, or offset it all around the screen, without worrying about having to offset particular values, of every element within that container element.
![[Pasted image 20211217195036.png|350]] --> ![[Pasted image 20211217195139.png|300]]

_Example *Relative Position*_:  what we'll do is set position of `#p1` to relative. Now we've set an anchor so now all offsets of this element are going to be relative to its normal document flow position which still remains right here. rest of the elements are still sitting in their original spots and this space is still completely unoccupied. Well the truth of the matter, the browser is thinking that it's actually occupied by the red element that we just moved over here.
```css
#p1 {
	background-color: #xxxxx;
	position: relative;
	top: 65px;
	left: 55px;
}
```
